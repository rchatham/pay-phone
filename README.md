### Arduino stuff
- [Arduino code for Pay Phone](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/rchatham/044c4320-8126-4371-ab3c-54f0d22aaedc)
- [sprintf function](https://arduinobasics.blogspot.com/2019/05/sprintf-function.html)


### Circuit Hacking
Speaker stuff for handset:
- [Adafruit Speaker Bonnet for Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-speaker-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi)

Likely similar to microphone in handset:
- [Electret Microphone - 20Hz-20KHz Omnidirectional](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1064)
- [Electret Microphones](http://www.openmusiclabs.com/learning/sensors/electret-microphones/)

Understanding audio jacks: - Might be similar to how handset is wired up.
- [Understanding TRRS and Audio Jacks](https://www.cablechick.com.au/blog/understanding-trrs-and-audio-jacks/)

Signal Processing: - Do I have to?
- [Interpreting microphone output signal](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/45117/interpreting-microphone-output-signal)

### Notes
Handset conections:
Speaker - Blk(GND)/Yel
Mic - Grn/Red - not tested
